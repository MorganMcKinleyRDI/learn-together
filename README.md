# Morgan McKinley's Learn Together
We'd like to give everyone an opportunity to share technical learning here at Morgan McKinley in an open forum.  It's the goal of this project to create a collection of our shared learning in a fun and interactive way!

## Want to learn something new?

Someone on the team may already have a good understanding of what you are trying to learn, and others could also benefit from learning it.  Add an "issue" with short description of the item, and prefix the title with "REQUEST".

## Learned something new?

Have you learned something new that you think others could benefit from learning it?  Add an "issue" to this repo with a short description of your learning idea.

## Links to learning resources

Nothing yet, but check back soon!
